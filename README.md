# Game engine (Java)
Nowadays most games are made using existing game engines like `Unreal engine` and `Unity`. I've used Unity for a long time and I was curious about how it worked under the hood, so I made my own game engine
(this project is actually from a few years ago, I just pushed it on GitHub now).
I have actually even made a game engine in Rust which is more complex than this one (based on Unity DOTS and Bevy), but it's private.

## Demo
This is just a small demo. As you can see I wrote the code to render sprites, do sprite sheet animations, read the buttons pressed to move the player around,
created a system that manages game objects, behaviors and scenes (like Unity MB)...
